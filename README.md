# Dining Data Dynamics Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **Dining Data Dynamics** project! This repository contains code and resources developed during the Data Science internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The project focuses on analyzing restaurant data to derive insights, visualize trends, and build predictive models.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dining-data-dynamics.git
cd dining-data-dynamics
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Tasks Overview

This project includes various tasks categorized into three levels. You are required to complete two tasks from each level.

### Level 1 Tasks

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Explore the dataset, identify dimensions, check for missing values, and analyze the target variable's distribution.

2. **Descriptive Analysis**
   - Calculate basic statistics for numerical columns and explore categorical variables.

3. **Geospatial Analysis**
   - Visualize restaurant locations and analyze their distribution.

### Level 2 Tasks

1. **Table Booking and Online Delivery Analysis**
   - Analyze the percentage of restaurants offering these services and compare ratings.

2. **Price Range Analysis**
   - Determine common price ranges and their average ratings.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features from existing data to enhance model performance.

### Level 3 Tasks

1. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Build a regression model to predict restaurant ratings based on features.

2. **Customer Preference Analysis**
   - Analyze relationships between cuisine types and ratings.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Create various visualizations to represent data insights effectively.
